# Assignment IV - â€” Binary Search Tree

============================================================================================================

## Problem 1. Binary Search Tree Implementation using linked lists 

This is a C program, compile this program and run.

### Input format

First, input a integer n and n nodes to insert into the tree.
Second, input a integer m and m data to delete the node of the tree.

### Output format

print all nodes of the tree with Infixorder and Levelorder respectively.

### Function explaination

pop_and_get_front : we can get the front of queue and pop.

isempty : to know whether the queue is empty or not.

push : push an element into the queue.

search : search a target by implementing the Binary search tree.

insert : insert a element into the tree.

_delete : delete a element from the tree.

printIn_inorder : print all nodes in inorder.

printIn_levelorder : print all nodes in levelorder.

Detailed explanation are writen in source code.

### How the program works

The program will do a serie of operation to the tree and finally print all nodes in inorder and levelorder.

## Problem 2. Treasure Hunter

This is a C program, compile this program and run.

### Input format

First, input a integer n and n nodes to insert into the tree.
And then, input two integers which represent the nodes of key and treasure respectively.

### Output format

The output will print the path of the process of finding key and treasure.

### Function explaination

search : search a target by implementing the Binary search tree.

insert : insert a element into the tree.

find_path : find the path from root to the target by implementing the BST.

Detailed explanation are writen in source code.

### How the program works

The program will find the path of key and treasure without suspend.
