# Assignment VI - â€” Sorting Algorithms

============================================================================================================

## Problem 1. Quick Sort 

This is a C program, compile this program and run.

### Input format

First, using fgets to input the array into string, since we need to process the commas and space later.
Second, by using the string token cut the substrings into integers and store them into integer array.

### Output format

Using the printArray function print all the process of Quick sort.

### Function explaination

swap: swap two elements of array

printArray: print the array according the format that follow the problem description.

partition: according the pivot separate the array into two parts.

quickSort: by using the function of partition, recursive and sort the array.

Detailed explanation are writen in source code.

### How the program works

It sort the array and print the process of quick sort.

============================================================================================================

## Problem 2. Selection Sort

This is a C program, compile this program and run.

### Input format

First, using fgets to input the array into string, since we need to process the commas and space later.
Second, by using the string token cut the substrings into integers and store them into integer array. 

### Output format

Using the printArray function print all the process of Selection sort.

### Function explaination

swap: swap two elements of array

printArray: print the array according the format that follow the problem description.

selectionSort: by using the selectionSort algorithm sort the array.

Detailed explanation are writen in source code.

### How the program works

It sort the array and print the process by using the selectionSort.

============================================================================================================

## Problem 3. Insertion Sort

This is a C program, compile this program and run.

### Input format

First, using fgets to input the array into string, since we need to process the commas and space later.
Second, by using the string token cut the substrings into integers and store them into integer array.

### Output format

Using the printArray function print all the process of Insertion sort.

### Function explaination

printArray: print the array according the format that follow the problem description.

insertionSort: It sort the array by using Insertion algorithm.

Detailed explanation are writen in source code.

### How the program works

It sort the array and print all the process by using insertionSort.

============================================================================================================

## Problem 4. Minimum Gap

This is a C program, compile this program and run.

### Input format

First, using fgets to input the array into string, since we need to process the commas and space later.
Second, by using the string token cut the substrings into integers and store them into integer array. 

### Output format

Using the printArray function print all the process of Merge sort.
And then, print an integer which is the Minimum gap of array.

### Function explaination

printArray: print the array according the format that follow the problem description.

merge: a function which can merge two segments and assign the elements of sorted segments into the original array.

mergeSort: a function which using the function merge and keep recursiving untill the array have sorted.

Detailed explanation are writen in source code.

### How the program works

It sort the array and print all the process by using the merge sort.
And then, it find the minimum gap of array.
